Hello, [(${userName})]!

It looks like you typed all matches. Well done! Short summary:
[# th:each="matchWithType : ${matchesTyped}"]
   - [(${matchWithType.match.fullLabel})] - [(${matchWithType.type.goals1})]:[(${matchWithType.type.goals2})]
[/]
You can still change them if you want to. Today's matches are assigned in application by red ribbon in top-left corner with label "TODAY".

Good Luck!
